# Node.js best practices starter

A generator of Node.js apps that is packed with best practices AND also build with simplicty in mind

## Three things you oughta to know

### 1. Best practices *on top of* known Node.js frameworks

We don't invent new wheels rather use your favorite framework and empower it with more structure and practices. For example, with a single command you get express/fastify based code base with ~100 additional best practices inside

### 2. SIMPLE like Node.js was meant to be

Keeping it simple, flat and based on native Node/JS capabilities is part of this project DNA. We believe that too many abstractions, high-complexity and fancy language features become soon a strategic slowdown for the team. To name a few example, our code flow is flat with almost no level of indirection, although using TypeScript - almost no features are being used besides types, for modularization we simply use... Node.js modules

### 3. Supports many technologies and frameworks

Since it's about good practices and simplicity, there is no need to narrow this code to specific framework or DB. We aim to support the major Node.js frameworks and databases

## A very quick start

- Open your terminal and type `npx practic`
- Answer few questions to customize for your own needs
- Start the project by typing `npm start` or run the test with `npm test`
- Learn by skimming through the code, or specifically search for #best-practice to focus on insights
- Search for #change-here to customize
