# Node.js best practices starter

A generator of Node.js apps that is packed with best practices AND also build with simplicty in mind

## Three things you oughta to know

**1. Best practices *on top of* known Node.js frameworks -** We don't invent new wheels rather use your favorite framework and empower it with more structure and practices. For example, with a single command you get express/fastify based code base with ~100 additional best practices inside

**2. SIMPLE like Node.js was meant to be -** Keeping it simple, flat and based on native Node/JS capabilities is part of this project DNA. We believe that too many abstractions, high-complexity and fancy language features become soon a strategic slowdown for the team. To name a few example, our code flow is flat with almost no level of indirection, although using TypeScript - almost no features are being used besides types, for modularization we simply use... Node.js modules

**3. Supports many technologies and frameworks -** Since it's about good practices and simplicity, there is no need to narrow this code to specific framework or DB. We aim to support the major Node.js frameworks and databases
