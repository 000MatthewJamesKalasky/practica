### Generate a Node.js app that is packed with best practices AND simplicty in mind. Based on our repo [Node.js best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) (77,000 stars)

ðŸ—“ **Alpha project:** This project is very premature WIP, please revisit by June 2022

# 3 things you oughta to know first

### 1. Best practices *on top of* known Node.js frameworks

We don't invent new wheels rather use your favorite framework and empower it with more structure and practices. For example, with a single command you get express/fastify based code base with ~100 additional best practices inside

### 2. SIMPLE like Node.js was meant to be

Keeping it simple, flat and based on native Node/JS capabilities is part of this project DNA. We believe that too many abstractions, high-complexity and fancy language features become soon a strategic slowdown for the team. To name a few example, our code flow is flat with almost no level of indirection, although using TypeScript - almost no features are being used besides types, for modularization we simply use... Node.js modules

### 3. Supports many technologies and frameworks

Since it's about good practices and simplicity, there is no need to narrow this code to specific framework or DB. We aim to support the major Node.js frameworks and databases

# A very quick start

- Open your terminal and type `npx practica`
- Answer few questions to customize for your own needs
- Start the project by typing `npm start` or run the test with `npm test`. Standard, ah?
- Become familiar with the code by reading it starting from index.ts. This is the nice part - The code is yours, no abstractions hiding
- Customize the routes and data model for your own needs by changing these 3 files (link soon)
- Feel free to adjust the code, the tests with 100% coverage protect your back

# Practices and features

We apply more than 100 practices and optimizations, you can opt-in or out for most of these features using our CLI flags. Following is few examples of features, to learn about the full list of features, [please visit here](https://practicajs.org/features)
