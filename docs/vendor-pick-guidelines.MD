Sometimes it's useful to include names of vendors that can address certain challenges and problems like npm packages, open source tools or even commercial products. To avoid overwhelmingly long lists or recommending non-reputable and unstable projects, we came up with the following rules:

- Only the top 3 vendors should be recommended – a vendor that appears in the top 3 results of a search engine (Google or GitHub sorted by popularity) for a given relevant keyword can be included in our recommendation.
- If it’s a npm package it must also be downloaded at least 5000 times a day on average.
- If it’s an open-source project, it must have been updated at least once in the last 6 months.
