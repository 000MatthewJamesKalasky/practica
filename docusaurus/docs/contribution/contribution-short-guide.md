## 3 things to consider

- Our philospophy is all about minimalism and simplicity - We strive to write less code, rely on existing and reputable libraries, stick to Node/JS standards and avoid adding our own abstractions
- Popular vendors only - Each technology and vendor that we introduce must super popular and reliable. For example, a library must one of the top 5 most starred in its category. See [full vendor choose instructions here](url)
